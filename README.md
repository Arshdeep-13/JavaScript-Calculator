# JavaScript-Calculator
What's Up Guys, I have made Responsive Calculator using JavaScript. It is one of my craziest project ever.

**Calculator app built with JavaScript that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user-friendly interface and responsive design make it easy to use on desktop and mobile devices. The app uses modern web development techniques, such as ES6 syntax and modular code structure, ensuring scalability and maintainability.**
